# JavaScript Lab 1

## Overview 
Hello In this lab I am to train my javaScript skills by making completing a few task that will train different areas of Java as a whole. 



By the end of this activity, you will have demonstrated your ability to:

- Manipulate variables to perform mathematical operations and string manipulation.
- Write and call functions that use parameters and return values.
- Use conditional logic inside functions to create more dynamic behavior.
- Refactor code to improve readability and reusability.

## The challenge

### Task One Flexible String Manipulation with Functions
1. Create a function called formatFullName that takes two parameters: firstName and lastName. The function should return the full name in the format lastName, firstName.
2. Format the firstName and lastName so that the first letter of each is always capatilized.
3. Add a condition that checks if either the first or last name is missing. If so, return a string saying “Invalid name input.”

### Task 2: Mathematical Operations with Multiple Parameters
1.  Write a function called calculateTotalCost that takes three parameters: price, quantity, and taxRate.
2. The function should calculate the total cost of items, including tax. Use the formula: totalCost = (price * quantity) * (1 + taxRate).
3. Ensure that price, quantity, and taxRate are all valid numbers. If any are invalid, return a string: “Invalid input.”


### Task 3: Functions with Conditional Logic
1. Write a function called checkEligibility that takes two parameters: age and isEmployed. The function should check if a person is eligible for a program based on the following rules:
    - If the person is over 18 and employed, they are eligible.
    - If the person is over 18 but unemployed, they are conditionally eligible.
    - If the person is 18 or younger, they are not eligible.
2. Return an appropriate string message for each scenario.

### Task 4: Refactoring for Reusability

1. Refactor the calculateTotalCost function from Task 2 to include an optional discount parameter. If the discount is provided, the function should subtract the discount from the total cost before applying tax.
2. If no discount is provided, calculate the total cost as before.


## What I did 
- to begin, I made a html File that contained sections for each of the challenges 
### Task One 
### Task Two 
### Task Three 
### Task four 



## Wwhat was used 
 -  JavaScript
    - For Loops
    - Conditionals  
    - DOM 
 - HTML
- CSS

## Refeection 
1. How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters?

2. What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?

3. How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code?
